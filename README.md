# go-cluster-kit

GoClusterKit is a framework designed to simplify the creation of distributed systems in Go. It provides a set of tools and components to build reliable and scalable distributed applications.

## Features

- **Node and Network Design**: Tools and structures to manage nodes and network communication.
- **Consensus Algorithm Implementation**: Integrated Raft consensus algorithm.
- **Data Storage and Replication**: Interfaces and utilities for data management and replication.
- **Transaction Management**: Tools for handling transaction lifecycle and conflict resolution.
- **Performance Optimization and Benchmarking**: Utilities for optimizing and benchmarking your distributed system.

## Status

go-cluster-kit is still in a very early phase and not suitable for anything other than expirements since the interface is likely to change.


## Philosophy

**go-cluster-kit** offers a straightforward approach to distributed systems development, encapsulating complex aspects like consensus protocols and data replication within a user-friendly API. The framework emphasizes robustness, performance, and clarity, with comprehensive documentation and examples to foster understanding. As I'm starting this project, I wanted it to be fully open-source, not just on the final code, but on the thought process and learnign journy.
